## Introduction

There are many different types of SVMs in this repository. 

## Why I created this project ?

In order to learn `SVMs` better, I built this repository to implement support vector machines. The package is under active development.

## How to install Support Vector Laboratory

Make sure you have installed `devtools`, if you don't have `devtools` installed, please run the following command first 
```{r}
install.packages("devtools")
```
Then you need to install `Rtools` to compile the `C++` code. 

After you installed `devtools` and `Rtools`, please run the following command :
```{r}
devtools::install_github("define957/manysvms")
```
Then you can have `SupportVectorLab` package on your PCã€‚

## Optimization
+ The dual form is solved by CLipDCD solver (Cliping Dual Coordinate Descent Method, implemented by RcppArmadillo).


## SVMs for classification

+ Hinge Loss Support Vector Classification
+ Pinball Loss Support Vector Classification
+ Least Squares Loss Support Vector Classification
+ Rescaled Quantile Loss Support Vector Classification
+ Bounded Quantile Loss Support Vector Classification

## SVMs for regression
+ Epsilon Insensitive Loss Support Vector Regression
+ Least Squares Loss Support Vector Regression
+ Bounded Quantile Loss Support Vector Regression

## Kernel options

+ Linear kernel
+ RBF kernel
+ Polynomial kernel

## Development environment and dependency

My enviroment: R 4.3.0, windows 11 x64 &#x2705;

Other test environment detail: 
+ Windows 10/11 x64 &#x2705;
+ Mac osx (ARM platform) &#x2705; 
+ Linux : We haven't tested it yet &#x2753;

Dependency: 

+ Rcpp
+ RcppArmadillo
